### Hi there
As a software engineer with a master's degree in artificial intelligence, I have a passion for using technology to solve complex problems. My experience in deep learning, machine learning, and data science tools has given me a strong foundation for creating innovative solutions that can drive business growth.

My technical expertise includes proficiency in Python, SQL, Django, Flask, and web development technologies such as React Js, Next Js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, with experience in SQL and NoSQL databases. I have also experience in AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.) and Docker. I am skilled at collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions that meet business requirements and exceed user expectations. 

I am an analytical thinker and a problem-solver with a dedication to continuous learning and professional development. With a focus on innovation and user-centred design, I am committed to creating software that delivers value to users and achieves business objectives.

If you're interested in connecting with me, please don't hesitate to send me a message. I'm always eager to collaborate and learn from like-minded professionals in the field.
