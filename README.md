### Hi there

As a recent MSc Artificial Intelligence graduate with a strong background in machine learning, data science and full-stack development, I am excited to begin my career in the tech industry.
With experience in technologies such as ML, DL, NLP, Python, SQL, Javascript, Flask and Django, I am comfortable working across the full stack and enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems. I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in this field. I am eager to join a team of motivated professionals and contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic and innovative company.
